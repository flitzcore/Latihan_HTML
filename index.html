            Yes, that photo is mine. The display is very different from what you
            see when you first open this website. When you first open the
            website, you see a figure with a neat, energetic, and confident
            appearance. But here looks a completely different figure. Yes,
            that's me outside the workspace. My friends say that I am a very
            enthusiastic person in the workspace, but I am originally a quiet
            person. I am an introvert who likes quiet time to think about new
            things, and interesting concepts. I can come across as a cheerful
            person, but can turn into a gloomy thinker if I focus on work. This
            allows me to focus more on getting the project done, while still
            allowing me to 're-emerge' and manage the team. I have experience in
            several competitions and organizations. This experience has allowed
            me to improve my critical and creative thinking skills. very useful
            thing to come up with brilliant ideas at crucial times. But the most
            meaningful thing that I got from this race and organization is how
            to manage the team and fit in the team. For a quiet person it is
            very easy to focus and get lost in thinking about solutions, but I
            realized that the most important thing is how to convey and channel
            these solutions so that everyone on the team can realize them. How
            to come across as a completely different person when leading a team
            and how to convey complex topics in simple terms to people. I am
            currently one of the lab assistants at the ITS B201 Telematics
            Laboratory. Through my current position, I learned how to manage a
            large organization, I also learned how to grow together in a team.
            As a lab assistant, I have encountered many situations where I had
            to teach programming to my juniors. I am very happy about this.
            Through this I can deepen my programming skills, and also learn to
            explain topics. I also had the opportunity to meet many people.
            These are the things that shaped me from the photo on the left to me
            on the first page.
